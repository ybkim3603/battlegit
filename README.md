BATTLEGIT is a simple game that fetches GitHub's Like, Fork, and Watch counts, allowing individuals to measure the score with the weight that we set, thereby adding elements as game by inducing competition among users, not mandatory uploads for career. As a result, it aims to trigger a virtuous cycle of the software development environment by generating healthy competition between developers.
